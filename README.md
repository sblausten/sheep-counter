# sheep-counter
A tiny but perfectly formed sinatra web app practicing MVC and Ajax testing - based on Mary Rose Cook's [Count](https://github.com/maryrosecook/count) exemplar.

## User stories
As a shepherd
I can see the number of sheep I've counted back into the pen
So I know if the whole flock is home

As a shepherd
I can increment the number of sheep
So I can record the fact that another sheep has gone into the pen

As a shepherd
I can reopen the app and see my latest count
So I don't lose track of my count if my browser crashes
